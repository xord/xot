## 🚀 About

**Xot** is a small utility library that was extracted for internal use to provide basic helper classes and functions across our own Ruby gems.

It’s not intended for general public use, but rather serves as a simple collection of utilities to make our own development process more efficient and consistent.

Feel free to explore, but please note that it’s not actively maintained or intended for broad adoption.

Add this line to your Gemfile:
```ruby
$ gem 'xot'
```

Then, install gem:
```bash

```

Or install it directly:
